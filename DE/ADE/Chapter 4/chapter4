ETL and ELT names

ETL:
1.Extract
2.Transform
3.Load

ELT:
1.Extract
2.Load
3.Transform

Understanding ETL-Pros and Cons
 -Data transformed during the above
 -Uses separate system to process data
Pros:
 -Lower data storage costs
 -PII security compliance
 
Cons:
 -Transformation errors/changes require new data pulls
 -Costs of separate system to process data

Understanding ELT-Pros and Cons
 - Data is loaded, then transformed
 - Uses the warehouse to transform the data
 
Pros:
 -No separate system to process data
 -Transformations can be rerun without impacting source systems
 -Works well for near real-time requirements
 
Cons:
 -Increased storage needs from raw data
 -Compliance with PII security standards
 
Data Cleaning

Data format cleaning
 -Update values to an expected format
  -Dates
  -Names of options
  -Capitalization
 -Ensures output is in a consistent format
 
Address parsing
 -Dividing  a street  address  into its components
 -Can use tools to validate addresses
 
Data validation
 -Range check
   -Is the value within the expected range?
   -Example: A person's age
 -Type check
   -Is the value the proper data type?
   -Example: Storing age as string vs number
 
Duplicate row elimination
 -This process gets rid of duplicate entries
 
Data governance
 -Standards
 -Regulations
 -Rules
 -Transparency
 -Law
 -Requirements
 
Data warehouse design example

Let's set the stage
 -A new startup company
 -Photo sharing app
 
Top-down, or bottoms up approach?

Considerations:
 -Vital to show business impact quickly
 -Top-down approach has a longer startup process

Decision:
 -Bottom-up approach
 -Sales data mart must the priority
 
Kimball-select the organizational process(step 1)
Considerations:
 -What type of customers purchase large volumes of photos?

Decision:
 -Develop customer purchases

Kimball-Declare the grain(step 2)
Considerations:
 -Data should be flexible to answer many questions
 -Selecting the lowest grain possible
Decision:
 -Tracking customer/photo purchases
 
Kimball-Identify the dimensions(step 3)
Considerations:
 -How do users describe the data that results the business process?
 -Customer prioritization
Decision:
 -Customer location(country & state)
 -Date customer joined
 -Default payment method
 
Kimball-Identify the facts(Step 4)
Considerations:
 -What are we answering?
Decision:
 -Time spent viewing photo before purchase
 -Photo cost and tax
 -Date of purchase
 
On-premise or cloud implementation
Considerations:
 -We do not want upfront costs for hardware/software infrastructure
 -Small team-focus on high volume activities
Decision:
 -Cloud implementation
 
ETL or ELT implementation
Considerations:
 -Keep all data
 -Cloud implementation allows us to scale compute as needed
Decision:
 -ELT implementation

Summary
 -Planning is critical
 -Tailor your approach based on the situation
