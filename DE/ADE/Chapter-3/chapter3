Data models
-Bottom-up, Kimball model=star & snowflake schemas

Fact table
-Measurements,metrics,or facts about an organization

Dimension table
-Dimensions/attributes about a process
-Holds reference data
-Dimension tables add more detail to fact table

Star schema
-A central fact table, with one or more dimensional tables
-Easy for business users

Snowflake schema
-Dimension table connected through another dimensional table

Kimball's four step process:

Step 1-Select the organizational process
 -Ask questions about a process
 -Kimball bottom-up approach starts with a business process
 
 Example of organizational processes:
 -Invoice and billing
 -Product quality monitoring
 -Marketing
 
Step 2-Declare the grain
 -Grain=level to store fact table
 -A level of data that cannot be split further
 
Examples of business processes:
-Music service->Song grain
-Shipping service->Line  item grain

Step 3-Identify the dimensions
-Choose  dimensions that apply to each row
-How to describe the data?
-Business users and analysts=valuable

Examples of common dimensions:
 -Time:  year,quarter,and month
 -Location:address,state,and country
 -Users:names and email address
 
Step 4-Identify the facts
 -Numerical facts for each fact table  row
 -What are we answering?
 -Metricsshould be true at selected grain
 
Examples of facts:
-Music service:total number of plays,sales revenue of a song
-Ride-sharing:travel distance,time needed

Summary:

Steps:
1.Select the organizational process.
2.Declare the grain.
3.Identify the dimensions.
4.Identify the facts.


Slowly Changing Dimensions

Type 1
 -Updae value in table
 -Will loose any history
 
Type2
 -Add a row with the updated value
 -The history is retained
 
Type 3
 -Add column to dimension table to trace chnages
 -Can view past and current data together
 -Can require reporting changes and limited tracking
 
Modern approach
 -Snapshot the whole dimension table
 -Use historical snapshots for historical reports
