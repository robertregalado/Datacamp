Data source layer
-All data sources for data warehouse
-Examples of data sources:
  -Transactional database
  -Log files
  -Spreadsheets
  
 Data staging layer
 -Layer extracts, transform, and clean data through ETL process
 -Contains ETL  process and storage tables
 
 ETL process within data staging layer
 -Extracted
 -Business rules applied
 -Staging database often used
 -Must be able to extract valid data
 -Batch / full loading
 
 Data storage layer
 -Data is stored  in warehouse and data marts
  -Data warehouse->Data mart
  -Data mart->Data warehouse
  
 Data presentation layer
 -Users interact with stored data
 -Users:
   -Use BI(Business Intelligence) tools
   -Use data mining tools
   -Create direct queries
   
 Presentation layer tools
 -Users interact with the presentation layer
   -Area of constant development
 
 Presentation Layer Groups:
 -Automated reporting/dashboarding tools
   -Goal:
     -Create reports needed for decision making
     -Create dashboards using historical data
   -Users:
     -Analysts
     -Citizen Data Scientist
 -BI/data analytics
   -Goal:
     -Tools for exploration(e.g. tableau,rapidminer,alteryx, looker,knime,oracle)
     -Looking for patterns
   -Users:
     -Analysts
     -Data Scientist
 -Direct queries
   -Goal:
     -Sophisticated tools for exploration(e.g.Azure, Python, R)
   -Users:
     -Analysts
     -Data Scientist
     -Data Engineer
     
 Inmon-top-down
 -Must decide:
   -On all data definitions, cleaning, and business rules
   -Before any data enters warehouse
   
 Pros and cons of top-down
 Advantages:
  -Single source of truth for organization
  -Normalization=less storage
  -Easy to change data marts to support reporting changes
 
 Disadvantages:
 -More joins=slower response time
 -Lengthy upfront work
  -Higher startup cost
  
Kimball-bottom-up
 -Denormalizes data
 -Focus on departmental data mart
 -Data moves directly from ETL to data marts
 
Pros and cons of bottom-up
Advantages:
 -Upfront development speed
  -Lower starup cost
 -Denormalized=user friendly
 
Disadvantages:
 -Increased  ETL processing time
 -Greater possibility of duplicate data
 -Ongoing development needed
 
 
OLAP systems
 -OLAP(online analytical processing)
 -Designed to support analysis of large amounts of data
 -Example dimesional organization;
   -country, state, city
   -years, months, days
 -OLAP reorganizes data into multidimensional format
 
OLAP cube
-OLAP cube key to OLAP system
-Faster processing vs. traditional relational databases
-Hypercubes have more than three dimensions

OLTP(online transaction processing)
-Designedfor processing simple database queries
-Used in source systems to data warehouse

Example for a credit card company
OLTP:
 -System tracks customer's purchase
 -Processes large amounts of simple database updates to account balances
OLAP:
 -Designed for anlyzing purchase data
 -Data organized by multiple dimensions
