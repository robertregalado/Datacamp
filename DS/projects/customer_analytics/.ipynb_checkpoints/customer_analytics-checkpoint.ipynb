Ensuring that your dataset is stored as efficiently as possible is crucial for allowing these models to run on a more reasonable timescale without having to reduce the size of the dataset.\n\nYou've been hired by a major online data science training provider called *Training Data Ltd.* to clean up one of their largest customer datasets. This dataset will eventually be used to predict whether their students are looking for a new job or not, information that they will then use to direct them to prospective recruiters.\n\nYou've been given access to `customer_train.csv`, which is a subset of their entire customer dataset, so you can create a proof-of-concept of a much more efficient storage solution. The dataset contains anonymized student information, and whether they were looking for a new job or not during training:\n\n| Column       | Description                                  |\n|------------- |--------------------------------------------- |\n| `student_id`   | A unique ID for each student.                 |\n| `city`  | A code for the city the student lives in.  |\n| `city_development_index` | A scaled development index for the city.       |\n| `gender` | The student's gender.       |\n| `relevant_experience` | An indicator of the student's work relevant experience.       |\n| `enrolled_university` | The type of university course enrolled in (if any).       |\n| `education_level` | The student's education level.       |\n| `major_discipline` | The educational discipline of the student.       |\n| `experience` | The student's total work experience (in years).       |\n| `company_size` | The number of employees at the student's current employer.       |\n| `last_new_job` | The number of years between the student's current and previous jobs.       |\n| `training_hours` | The number of hours of training completed.       |\n| `job_change` | An indicator of whether the student is looking for a new job (`1`) or not (`0`).       |","metadata":{},"id":"a09e6d54-bf3f-4632-b299-bd49d5c80d5f","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Start your code here!\nimport pandas as pd","metadata":{},"id":"7dacda55-041c-4985-87ee-af451dcd6d8c","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"source":"# Load the dataset\nds_jobs = pd.read_csv(\"customer_train.csv\")\n\n# Copy the DataFrame for cleaning\nds_jobs_clean = ds_jobs.copy()\n\n# Create a dictionary of columns containing ordered categorical data\nordered_cats = {\n    'relevant_experience': ['No relevant experience', 'Has relevant experience'],\n    'enrolled_university': ['no_enrollment', 'Part time course', 'Full time course'],\n    'education_level': ['Primary School', 'High School', 'Graduate', 'Masters', 'Phd'],\n    'experience': ['<1'] + list(map(str, range(1, 21))) + ['>20'],\n    'company_size': ['<10', '10-49', '50-99', '100-499', '500-999', '1000-4999', '5000-9999', '10000+'],\n    'last_new_job': ['never', '1', '2', '3', '4', '>4']\n}\n\n# Loop through DataFrame columns to efficiently change data types\nfor col in ds_jobs_clean:\n    \n    # Convert integer columns to int32\n    if ds_jobs_clean[col].dtype == 'int':\n        ds_jobs_clean[col] = ds_jobs_clean[col].astype('int32')\n    \n    # Convert float columns to float16\n    elif ds_jobs_clean[col].dtype == 'float':\n        ds_jobs_clean[col] = ds_jobs_clean[col].astype('float16')\n    \n    # Convert columns containing ordered categorical data to ordered categories using dict\n    elif col in ordered_cats.keys():\n        category = pd.CategoricalDtype(ordered_cats[col], ordered=True)\n        ds_jobs_clean[col] = ds_jobs_clean[col].astype(category)\n    \n    # Convert remaining columns to standard categories\n    else:\n        ds_jobs_clean[col] = ds_jobs_clean[col].astype('category')\n        \n# Filter students with 10 or more years experience at companies with at least 1000 employees\nds_jobs_clean = ds_jobs_clean[(ds_jobs_clean['experience'] >= '10') & (ds_jobs_clean['company_size'] >= '1000-4999')]","metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","id":"93d9a3fa-98ac-4051-95b1-25ed93ecfbb8","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"editor":"DataCamp Workspace"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
